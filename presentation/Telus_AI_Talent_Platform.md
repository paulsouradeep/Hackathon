## Slide 4: Candidate Journey Demo

### Example: Rahul Sharma applies for "Senior Software Engineer"

**Step 1: AI Processing**
- Resume parsed: Python, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, 6 years exp
- Semantic embedding generated

**Step 2: Multi-Role Matching**
1. **Senior Software Engineer**: 95% match (AUTO)
2. **Cloud Data Engineer**: 88% match (REVIEW) 
3. **DevOps Specialist**: 82% match (REVIEW)

**Step 3: Intelligent Routing**
- AUTO: Immediate recruiter notification
- REVIEW: Flagged for human evaluation
- Gap Analysis: Missing GCP for Cloud Data Engineer role

**Step 4: Personalized Recommendations**
- Training: "GCP Fundamentals for AWS Professionals"
- Certification: "Google Cloud Data Engineer"

---

## Slide 5: Human-in-the-Loop & Trust Framework

### Multi-Layer Safety Net

**Layer 1: Confidence Scoring**
- AUTO (≥85%): High confidence matches
- REVIEW (70-85%): Human validation required  
- HUMAN (<70%): Mandatory recruiter review

**Layer 2: Recruiter Workflow**
- Clear AI explanations for every recommendation
- One-click accept/reject with structured feedback
- Override capability with reason codes

**Layer 3: Continuous Learning**
- Recruiter feedback captured and analyzed
- Model retraining based on override patterns
- Bias detection through feedback analysis

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Low confidence → Human review queue
- High false positive rate → Auto-pause system
- Model degradation → Rollback to previous version

## Slide 6: "Near-Miss to Next Hire" Innovation

### Skill Knowledge Graph Approach

**Traditional**: Binary skill matching (have/don't have)
**Our Innovation**: Relational skill understanding

```
Python ──has_library──▶ Pandas
  │                        │
  │                   adjacent_to
  │                        │
  └──prerequisite_for──▶ NumPy ──develops──▶ Data Analysis
```

### Gap Analysis & Training Pipeline
1. **Identify Gaps**: Missing skills vs. job requirements
2. **Find Adjacencies**: Related skills candidate already has
3. **Generate Pathways**: Personalized learning recommendations
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor training completion and re-evaluate

### Business Impact
- Convert 15-20% of "near-miss" candidates within 6 months
- Build future-ready talent pipeline
- Reduce external hiring dependency
