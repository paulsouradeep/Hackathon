# Talent Matching Algorithm Improvements

## Problem Identified
The original matching algorithm was producing **negative percentages** (e.g., -4%) for some job-resume matches, which should never occur in a percentage-based scoring system.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **FAISS Inner Product Issues**: The original algorithm used FAISS `IndexFlatIP` which can produce negative similarity scores when vectors are not properly normalized or have poor semantic similarity.
2. **Single Scoring Method**: Relied only on semantic similarity without considering skill-specific matching.
3. **No Score Validation**: No checks to ensure scores remained within valid ranges (0-100%).

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Scoring System
- **Semantic Similarity (30%)**: Using sentence transformers for contextual understanding
- **Skill Matching (40%)**: Direct skill comparison with normalization
- **Experience Matching (20%)**: Years of experience vs job requirements
- **TF-IDF Similarity (10%)**: Term frequency analysis for skill keywords

### 2. Enhanced Skill Processing
- **Skill Normalization**: Maps common abbreviations (js â†’ javascript, k8s â†’ kubernetes)
- **Category-Based Matching**: Groups related skills for partial credit
- **Skill Extraction**: Improved parsing from resume text using pattern matching

### 3. Score Validation & Normalization
- **Positive Score Guarantee**: All individual scores are clamped to [0, 1] range
- **Weighted Combination**: Combines multiple scoring methods with appropriate weights
- **Percentage Conversion**: Final scores converted to 0-100% range

### 4. Improved Resume Parsing
- **Enhanced Text Processing**: Better extraction of skills and experience
- **Multiple Pattern Recognition**: Various formats for experience years
- **Skill Categories**: Organized skills into logical groups for better matching

## Key Features of New Algorithm

### Score Breakdown
Each match now provides detailed breakdown:
```json
{
  "similarity_score": 78.6,
  "score_breakdown": {
    "semantic_score": 0.556,
    "skill_score": 0.887,
    "experience_score": 1.000,
    "tfidf_score": 0.234,
    "final_score": 0.786
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Explanations
More informative match explanations:
- âœ“ Key skills: microservices, python, docker
- âœ“ Bonus skills: react
- âœ“ Experience: 6 years (excellent fit)
- âš  Missing: terraform, ci/cd
- ðŸŽ¯ Strong match

### Confidence Bands
Improved thresholds:
- **AUTO** (â‰¥80%): High confidence matches
- **REVIEW** (60-79%): Good matches needing review
- **HUMAN** (<60%): Requires human evaluation

## Test Results

### Comprehensive Testing
âœ… **25 sample candidate matches** - All scores positive (0-100%)
âœ… **Edge cases handled** - No skills, mismatched skills, single skill
âœ… **Skill normalization** - Common abbreviations properly mapped

### Performance Improvements
- **No negative scores**: 100% of matches now produce valid percentages
- **Better accuracy**: Multi-dimensional scoring provides more nuanced matching
- **Detailed insights**: Score breakdowns help recruiters understand matches

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `models/improved_ai_models.py` - New matching algorithm
